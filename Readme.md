# Mars Rover Functional Programming

I have solved the problem defined [HERE](https://github.com/arvindkgs/Mars-Rover-Traditional/blob/master/README.md) using functional programming.

You can see how concise this code looks.

I have used [fold](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/fold.html) to reduce the the sequence of instructions to a single final position, which is the destination expected.
